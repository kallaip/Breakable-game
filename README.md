# Breakable-game
Experimenting with Unity, FPS-like simple game with procedural level generation

You have to survive to get down from a tower built of easy-braking glass platforms. You have to shoot pieces carefully to
get a way down, and kill the evil crystal in the centre of the tower. Be careful not to fall or make the tower collapsed by your shots.
